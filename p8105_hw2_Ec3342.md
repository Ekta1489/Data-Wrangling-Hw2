# Question 1

## Reading and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet.

\#Mentioned the path to the xlsx file using path =
“./data/Trash\_wheet\_data.xlsx”, specified the sheet to read by
providing the name of the sheet which is Mr. Trash Wheel here. Cleaned
the variable names so that they are reasonable, omitted the rows that do
not include dumpster-specific data, rounded the number of sports balls
to the nearest integer.

``` r
trashwheel_data = 
  read_excel(
    path = "./data/Trash_wheet_data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(., dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

## Reading and cleaning the precipitation data for 2017 and 2018.

\#Omitted the rows without precipitation data and added a variable year
which is = 2017 for precipitaion\_data\_2017 and 2018 for
precipitation\_data\_2018.Combined both the precipitation data
(precipitation\_data\_2017 and precipitation\_data\_2018) to form
combined\_data. In the combined\_data used month.name to convert the
month from numeric to character variable.

``` r
precipitation_data_2017 =
  read_excel(
    path = "./data/Trash_wheet_data.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1
    ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(
    year = 2017
    )

precipitation_data_2018 =
  read_excel(
    path = "./data/Trash_wheet_data.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
    ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(
    year = 2018
    )

combined_data = union_all(
  precipitation_data_2017, precipitation_data_2018
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month] 
    )
```

## Describing both the datasets\!

The number of observations in trashwheel\_data is 344, The number of
observations in precipitation\_data\_2017 is 12, The number of
observations in precipitation\_data\_2018 is 12, The number of
observations in combined\_data is 24.
